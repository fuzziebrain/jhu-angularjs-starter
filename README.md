# Coursera Assignment Template - Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS

## Pre-requisite
1. Node.js (see https://nodejs.org/ for installation and setup)
2. [Bower](https://bower.io/): `npm install -g bower`
3. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): `npm install -g grunt-cli`

## Installation
1. Fork and clone the project
2. Set the project root folder as the current working directory
3. Install all dependencies: `npm install`

## Run
The default Grunt task will start a BrowserSync instance for local development. All development should be done in the `www` folder. You may use Bower to install additional dependencies such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

Command: `grunt`

## Deploy
When ready, the web application can be deployed to the `docs` directory. Use the `docs` folder as the source for your project's GitHub Page.

Command: `grunt deploy`
